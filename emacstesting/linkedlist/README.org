* Linked list GAS assembly program

** Purpose
-Generates linked list data structure, which is created in memory space
 statically allocated (right now 3000bytes)
-You can add new elements, cut old elements and print whole linked list
 data structure
-linkedlist.s is contains linked list manipulation logic and _start body, other printing.s
 contains printing logic

** Linkedlist.s
-Elements are added using add_head function. Value to store is given to
 %rbx register before calling the function
-To cut the head just simply call the cut_head procedure
-To print the linked list call the pre_print procedure
-Printing function calls functions from printing.s

** Printing
-Printing program allows to convert a numeric 0x value to ascii for
 future printing
-Value which is getting printed is contained inside var1 label
-optimizing function allows to skip first 8 bytes if they are all zeroes
-It is moved to %r8 register from a label and then %r8 is used in
 printing functions as a value for print
-Parse intro is used becuase there is no _start body to put values
 required to start parsing the number to ascii.
-Parse_start checks if lowest number is 0-9 or a-f, if it's 0-9 then
 calls a function for 0-9 parsing, otherwise, stays in the same function
 for a-f conversion
-Register %r12 is used to store converted ascii-fied numbers.
-Check_for_overflow is used to see if %r12 is overflowed. If it's so -
 %r12 value is stored inside %r14
-%r14 and %r12 contain reversed version of the converted number and need
 to be reversed. Stack is used for it

** Debugging
-Contains few written gdb scritp functions.
-Print_list just prints current linked list inside gdb environment
-assert_list_value takes an array {0, 1, 2, 3} of elements as first
 argument and it's length (from zero) as second argument and checks if
 array values are equal to linkedlist values. The right-est element is
 the head of the linked list. Core node is not included
-assert_list_length takes a length argument and checks if the length of
 the linked list is equal to that value
